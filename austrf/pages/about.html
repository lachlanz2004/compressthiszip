      <br />
      <p dir="ltr">The Australian Training Company is a &lsquo;not-for-profit&rsquo; company formed in 1994, to introduce structured training and employment opportunities for sports people through promoting apprentices and traineeships. <br>
        <br>
      The underlying strategy was to better equip these young people for life beyond sport.&nbsp; ATCs group training operation has progressively grown by offering the same opportunities to a broader market and providing innovative solutions to business needs.</p>
      <p dir="ltr"><span id="docs-internal-guid-be090156-7fff-4e40-f12e-9aa797ac6e79">In 1998, in response to increasing industry demands for tailored education programs ATC became a Registered Training Organisation (RTO).&nbsp; ATCs training operation promotes flexible study arrangements and an inclusive learning culture for all.</span><br>
